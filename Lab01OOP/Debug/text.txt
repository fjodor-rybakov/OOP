In the depths of Siberian ores
Keep your patience,
Do not lose your sorrowful work
And we have a great desire.

Unfortunately, a faithful sister,
Hope in a gloomy dungeon
It will awake cheerfulness and merriment,
The desired time will come:

Love and friendship is up to you
They will reach through the gloomy gates,
As in your convict burrows
My free voice comes.

The chains of the heavy will fall,
Dungeons will collapse - and freedom
You will be cheerfully at the entrance,
And the brothers will give you the sword.
